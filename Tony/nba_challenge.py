paragraph = "The Lakers went all in this offseason and swung a deal for former Pelicans forward Anthony Davis. \n\
They sent a package of Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Josh Hart, and 3 first-round picks to New Orleans to land Davis. \n\
Those three have made good developments with the Pelicans, especially Brandon Ingram. \n\
But, the deal is still a huge win for the Lakers as Lebron, Davis, and company have put together an incredible season. \n\
Los Angeles has ridden James and Davis, along with a supporting cast built around them, to the second-best record in the NBA. \n\
The Lakers ended the season atop the Western Conference with a record of 49-14. \n\
They were narrowly behind the Bucks for the best record in the league. \n\
Davis proved to the final piece necessary for the Lakers to rebound from missing the playoff√≠s last year. \n\
Los Angeles was a dominant club on both sides of the ball and are in a position to have another successful year next season."
